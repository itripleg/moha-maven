# Milestone: Email Notification System Working

**Timestamp:** 2026-01-19T03:29:38.001631+00:00
**Category:** infrastructure
**Significance:** Maven can now autonomously send email alerts when high-confidence trading opportunities are detected.

## Description

Successfully tested and fixed the Maven email notification system. The motherhaven.app API uses camelCase field names (htmlContent, textContent, fromName, fromEmail) instead of snake_case.

## Metadata

  "fix_applied": "camelCase field names for API",
