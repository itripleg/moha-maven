## Action

Fix MoHa Maven persistence paths and verify dual-write to git + postgres

## Reasoning

Discovered path resolution issue - MAVEN_BASE_DIR was defaulting to filesystem root (/) instead of /app in Docker container. Added MAVEN_BASE_DIR=/app to docker-compose.yml. This ensures git files (.moha/maven/) and postgres (maven_decisions) both get records. Testing with MoHa camel case branding per Boss's request. This is the real persistence test for our git-first architecture.
